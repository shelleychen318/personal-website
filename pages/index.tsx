            What excites me about software development is being able to merge my
            creativity with problem-solving skills to create innovative
            solutions that address real problems. I enjoy learning new
            technologies and crafting engaging products with intuitive UI.

            In my free time, I enjoy travelling, going on hikes, and trying out
            new restaurants!
